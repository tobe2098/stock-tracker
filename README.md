# stocktracker
A stock-tracker using Qt and C++


## To-do
- [ ] If the stock is not found, search the database for it and add it to tracked stocks. For now that cannot happen because we load all on startup.
- Cross button for stocks (deletes from memory but not from database?)
- Delete button for stocks (deletes from memory and from database)
- Load json from API query for history (try to make it a rich query, intra and interday)

What is MVC?

MVC is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main components:

    Model:
        What it is: The Model represents the application's data and the business logic that operates on that data. It's completely independent of the user interface.
        Its Responsibilities:
            Storing data (e.g., stock symbols, prices, historical data).
            Defining the rules and operations for manipulating that data (e.g., calculating percentage change, fetching new data from an API).
            Notifying interested parties (Views or Controllers) when its data changes.
        Analogy: Think of the Model as the brain of your application, holding all the facts and knowing how to process them, but without caring how those facts are displayed.

    View:
        What it is: The View is the user interface. It's responsible for presenting the data from the Model to the user.
        Its Responsibilities:
            Displaying information (e.g., a list of stocks, a chart).
            Receiving user input (e.g., button clicks, text entry).
            It does not contain any business logic or data storage itself. It merely reflects the state of the Model.
        Analogy: The View is like the face of your application. It shows information and receives input, but doesn't understand the meaning of the data or how to process it.

    Controller:
        What it is: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input, translates it into actions, and updates the Model or View accordingly.
        Its Responsibilities:
            Receiving input from the View (e.g., a user clicks "Add Stock").
            Interpreting that input and deciding what action to take (e.g., tell the Model to fetch new stock data).
            Updating the Model based on user actions.
            Updating the View to reflect changes in the Model (though often the Model directly notifies the View, or the Controller orchestrates this).
        Analogy: The Controller is like the nervous system that connects the brain (Model) to the face (View), processing signals and coordinating responses.

Why use MVC?

    Separation of Concerns: Each component has a clear, distinct responsibility. This makes the code easier to understand, develop, and debug.
    Maintainability: Changes to the UI (View) don't necessarily require changes to the data logic (Model), and vice-versa.
    Testability: You can test the Model independently of the UI, which is crucial for ensuring your core logic is correct.
    Flexibility: You could potentially have multiple Views for the same Model (e.g., a table view and a chart view showing the same stock data).

MVC and Qt's Architecture

Qt's powerful Model/View programming framework is a prime example of how MVC is applied. Qt provides abstract classes like QAbstractItemModel, QAbstractItemView, and QAbstractProxyModel that encourage this separation. While we might not jump into QAbstractItemModel immediately (it's a bit more advanced), understanding its underlying philosophy helps. Qt's Signals & Slots mechanism is perfect for communication between these components:

    View emits a signal (e.g., a button clicked() signal).
    Controller connects to that signal and executes a slot (e.g., onAddStockButtonClicked()).
    Controller calls a method on the Model (e.g., stockModel->addStock("GOOGL")).
    Model processes the request and, if its data changes, emits a signal (e.g., dataChanged()).
    View (or Controller) connects to the Model's signal and updates its display.

Design Decisions for our Stock Tracker using MVC:

Let's apply this to our stock tracker:

    The Model (What data do we need?):
        Individual Stock Data: For each stock, we'll need:
            symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "GOOGL")
            name (e.g., "Apple Inc.", "Alphabet Inc.")
            currentPrice
            priceChange (absolute)
            priceChangePercent
            volume
            lastUpdatedTimestamp
            historicalData (for charts: an array of (timestamp, open, high, low, close) tuples or similar).
        Collection of Stocks: We'll need a way to manage multiple stocks that the user is tracking. This could be a QList or QVector of Stock objects, or a QMap where the key is the stock symbol.
        Data Persistence: How do we save the list of tracked stocks so they reappear when the app restarts? (e.g., JSON file, simple text file, or even a small local database like SQLite). We'll tackle this later, but it's a Model concern.
        Data Source: Where does the stock data come from? (e.g., a financial API). The Model will contain the logic to fetch this data.

    The View (How will it look?):
        Main Window (QMainWindow): Our top-level container.
        Stock List/Table: A QListWidget or QTableWidget (or later, a QTableView with a custom model) to show the list of tracked stocks with their current price, change, etc.
        Detail/Chart Area: A dedicated area to display more details about a selected stock, including its historical chart. This could be a QWidget containing a QLabel for details and a QChartView (from QtCharts) for the plot.
        Input Fields/Buttons:
            A QLineEdit for entering a stock symbol to add.
            A QPushButton for "Add Stock".
            Buttons for "Remove Stock", "Refresh All", "Settings".
            A QComboBox or QButtonGroup for selecting the chart type (heatmap, trend, candle).
        Status Bar: A QStatusBar to show messages (e.g., "Fetching data...", "Error: Invalid symbol").

    The Controller (How do things connect?):
        The MainWindow class itself often acts as a Controller, connecting UI signals to Model slots, or vice-versa.
        When the "Add Stock" button is clicked, the Controller will:
            Get the symbol from the QLineEdit.
            Tell the Model to fetch data for that symbol and add it.
            If the Model successfully adds the stock, the View will be updated.
        When a stock is selected in the list, the Controller will:
            Get the selected stock's symbol.
            Tell the Model to retrieve its detailed and historical data.
            Update the detail/chart View with this data.
